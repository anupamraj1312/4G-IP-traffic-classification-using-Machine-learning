# 4G IP traffic classification using machine learning

In this research, we have using various Machine learning models i.e., Naive Bayes, KNN, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest to classify packets into their respective user activities.
The dataset was created by capturing packets on a 4G connection using Wireshark. Then the captured packets were divided into various flows and 65 flow features were extracted for training the model. Random forest gave the best accuracy of around 87%.
